![Make memories with your flowers](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/89273b6e-ea78-4b71-b3b3-9eb84b67f2ee.jpg)

This is my first post on the grid. Oh the pressure. 

I have a charming flower shop with my husband Peter in Sedona, Az. My name is Gari. We're at the shop every day with Saskia our cat. 

Peter is a master florist and together, he and I design your daily special occasion flower gifts and your wedding flowers too.

One bouquet or a room full, every attention is given to the details that bring a vision together of beautiful flowers in superior design.

I'm looking forward to posting photos to inspire your flower Jones.
