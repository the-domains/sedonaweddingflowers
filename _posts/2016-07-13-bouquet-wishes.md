OK, ok.

Gari here, not Robin Leach, but let's talk about the wedding bouquet. 

You have your partner, you have the date, the license and the, ya know, the one that's going to marry you two. And oh yeah, the ring, or rings. Usually. So.... What else do you need to make the picture complete? Flowers.

Like the nose on your face, something would be missing without them.

We'll talk more. Later.
